# Accelerator Guide

**DRAFT**

Accelerator is logically executed across 3 sequential sections.

1. AML Ops Design:
    * Operating Model  (who does what, where?):
      * Maturity curve
      * Roles, responsibilities – MLOps
      * Roles responsibilities for the project scope
      * Skilling Plan – Prescriptive to roles. Not just “do Azure DS Associate”
    * Design of infrastructure layout from an operational standpoint. – Network, RBAC etc 

2. Deploy: Infrastructure provisioning 
    * Templates for deployment – ARM, Terraform
    * Design Validation checklists
    * Validation test scripts. Validate that the environment is working as intended.

3. Migrate/ Operate: 
    * Code artefacts to move your first workload (existing model) onto AML and MLOPs it.
    * Operational best practices
